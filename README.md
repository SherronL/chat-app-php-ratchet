# chat-app-php-ratchet

You need to install the following first:
* composer
* jquery
* bootstrap

If using XAMPP then it's plug and play:
* make sure the project is in the xampp/htdocs/ folder:
* Start Apache and MySQL
* Start server in terminal by running "php server.php"
* Then go to http://localhost/chat-app-php-ratchet
